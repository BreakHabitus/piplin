    Piplin is a language embedded in Clojure that lets you synthesize regular Clojure code into hardware. It includes a simulator, waveform viweer, and Verilog code generator, along with a library of types and functions to generate state machines, memories, and mathematical expressions.

    <h2>Make Real Hardware</h2>
    <p>Piplin can generable synthesizable Verilog that all FPGA toolchains can understand. You can use maps, enums, tagged unions, and fixed point math with normal Clojure syntax and still have synthesizable code.</p>

    <h2>Use the Power of Clojure</h2>
    <p>Piplin is just plain Clojure code. This means that you can use namespaces to organize your code, functions to create reusable computations, and higher order functions to realize powerful, abstract combinations of hardware functions. In addition to these tools, Piplin uses [Prismatic's Plumbing's graphs](https://github.com/Prismatic/plumbing) to compose functions and registers into modules, Piplin's abstraction for composable stateful hardware.</p>

    <h2>REPL and Testing</h2>
    <p>Piplin allows you to simulate your hardware, giving you results in an easy-to-understand format that's designed for testability. Simulations can also be viewed graphically as waveforms. Simulations can also be automatically verified against the Verilog implementation to ensure the correctness of the compiler!</p>
